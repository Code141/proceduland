Chuck loader and procedural terrain generation

A web worker compute chunk by chunk the necessary level of detail
and return buffers with only the necessary vertices / faces to display

the 2d height map is generated by some harmonic perlin noise but could be replaced by anything else,
a black and white height map png for example could be used.

# Features :
* Chunks generation in separated thread with a dedicated webworker
* LOD (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail)
* Moving around with WASD will refreash all necessary chunks with new appropriate LOD
* Procedural terrain generation (simplex2)
* Fast reload, Worker store in buffers only whats needed where and when it is. (reload 2km diametre zone in less than one seconde with a tesselation ground's precision of 25cm)
* UV mapping generated

# To do :
* Finish tesselation cracks and parents / neigbour detection algo (While breaking diagonals, N S E W are diplayed. it should't)
* Jumbo chunks (chunks with size doubled for less number of mesh's objects)
* Vertices morphing for eye smooth replacement chunks
* Normal's map generation
* Texture splatting with bumpmap
* JSM it
